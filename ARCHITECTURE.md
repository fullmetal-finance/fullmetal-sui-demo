## 1. Thesis in one paragraph

In traditional bilateral derivatives, each institution posts collateral that
then sits **idle** with custodians and intermediaries who earn the fees while
the poster earns nothing. Fullmetal keeps that collateral productive: it lives
in one on-chain pool per institution, is **rehypothecated** into DeepBook's
lending pool to earn interest, and is **provably recallable in the same
transaction** the moment risk spikes — something the legacy regime forbids
precisely because, off-chain, you can't verify the collateral is still there.

## 2. Module map

The package is `fullmetal` (Move 2024, framework + OZ math + `deepbook_margin`).

| Module | Kind | Responsibility | External deps |
|---|---|---|---|
| `errors` | leaf | One canonical error-code registry (getters) | — |
| `events` | leaf | BCS-stable event schema for the indexer/frontend | — |
| `protocol` | singleton | `ProtocolCap` + `OtcAllowlist` (which OTC witnesses may move margin) | — |
| `registry` | singleton | `HandleRegistry` — unique institution handles | — |
| `institution` | core | One shared pooled-collateral object per tenant; caps; traders; reserved/required accounting; the OTC + rehypo seams | — |
| `settlement` | seam | Hot-potato atomic value transfer between two institutions | — |
| `oracle` | singleton | Keeper-pushed prices + volatility trigger | — |
| `rehypo` | integration | Supply/recall institution collateral ↔ DeepBook margin pool | `deepbook_margin` |
| `otc_forward` | product | Bilateral forward contract object; MTM, funding, liquidation; the `open_from_rfq` + `RfqWitness` seam | OZ `fp_math`, `math` |
| `rfq` | product | Request-for-quote: firm collateral-backed quotes → atomic single-signer accept | — |
| `direct` | product | Direct bilateral offer ("type the counterparty's org ID"): proposer fixes all terms + commits collateral first → named desk accepts. Mirror of `rfq`, reuses `open_from_rfq`/`RfqWitness` | — |

## 3. Object model

What is an **object** (has `key`, lives on-chain with an ID), what is **owned**
vs **shared**, and what is a plain struct/field.

Key choices (evidence in [§10](#10-design-decisions)):

- **Collateral is one pooled `Balance<C>` in the shared `Institution`** — never
  per-position. This is the DeepBook `BalanceManager` pattern and is what makes
  cross-margin possible.
- **`Institution` is `key`-only (no `store`)** → it can only ever be shared, never
  wrapped or stolen, and can be mutated permissionlessly (liquidation, recall).
- **Capabilities are objects** (`AdminCap`/`TraderCap`/`ProtocolCap`/keeper caps),
  ID-bound and revocable — not address→role mappings.
- **An OTC contract is its own shared object** (bilateral, bespoke), referencing
  both institutions by `ID` — vs. a standardized exchange "position-as-row".
- **The DeepBook `SupplierCap` lives as a dynamic field on the institution**, so
  the institution itself is the lender while the core module stays DeepBook-free.

---

## 4. Capabilities & authorization

| Cap | Ability | Holder | Authorizes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ProtocolCap` | key, store | platform | allowlist/kill OTC witnesses |
| `AdminCap` | key, store | institution admin(s) | treasury in/out, grant/revoke traders, pause, rehypothecate/recall |
| `TraderCap` | key, store | a trader | open contracts up to `book_size` |
| `OracleAdminCap` | key, store | oracle operator | register feeds, mint keepers, clear triggers |
| `KeeperCap` | key, store | price keeper | push prices |

**Revocation** (caps live in users' wallets, can't be deleted remotely):
- Per-cap: removed from the institution's `live_*_caps` VecSet → guard fails.
- Mass (traders): bump `cap_epoch`; every existing `TraderCap` fails the epoch check (O(1)).

**Cross-package seam (witness pattern).** The `otc_forward` and `rehypo`
modules are separate from `institution`, so they can't use `public(package)`.
They authorize via a `drop` **witness** type that only their own module can
construct, checked against the protocol `OtcAllowlist`. `otc_forward`'s witness
is `OtcWitness`; the `ProtocolCap` holder must allowlist its type-name once at
deploy. `reserve_margin` additionally requires the trader's own `&TraderCap`
(double gate: "an allowed OTC package is calling" **and** "this trader
authorized it"). The witness type-name is recorded in `ContractRef` so **only
the package that reserved a contract can release it**.

---

## 5. Data structures — what is tracked where

| Table / field | Lives in | Key → Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `HandleRegistry.handles` | registry (shared) | `String → ID` | unique institution handle → object ID |
| `HandleRegistry.reverse` | registry (shared) | `ID → String` | display / reverse lookup |
| `OtcAllowlist.witnesses` | protocol (shared) | `ascii::String → bool` | OTC/rehypo witness type-names trusted to move margin |
| `Institution.traders` | institution (shared) | `address → TraderInfo` | per-trader `{book_size, deployed, withdraw_permission, active, cap_id}` |
| `Institution.contracts` | institution (shared) | `ID → ContractRef` | per-contract `{trader, counterparty, im_reserved, maintenance_required, open, witness}` — the cross-margin requirement ledger |
| `Institution.live_trader_caps` | institution (shared) | `VecSet<ID>` | which TraderCaps are valid |
| `AdminRegistry.live_admin_caps` | institution (shared) | `VecSet<ID>` | which AdminCaps are valid |
| `RiskOracle.feeds` | oracle (shared) | `String → Feed` | per-symbol price + trigger state |
| `SupplierCap` | dynamic field on `Institution.id` | — | the institution's DeepBook lending position handle |

`Institution` scalar state: `treasury: Balance<C>`, `reserved: u64`,
`total_required: u64`, `rehypothecated: u64`, `cap_epoch: u64`, `paused: bool`,
`handle`, `suins_name: Option<String>`, `rehypo_cap: Option<ID>`.

---

## 6. The accounting model (the heart)

Single pooled balance, with **encumbrance tracked as integer overlays** — funds
are reserved, not physically moved into per-contract escrows.

```
equity   E = balance(treasury) + rehypothecated      (assets we control, liquid + in DeepBook)
reserved R = Σ ContractRef.im_reserved               (initial margin encumbrance)
required M = Σ ContractRef.maintenance_required       (= 0.70 · IM per contract)

available (economic free)   = saturating(E − R)       ← withdraw & reserve gate on this
liquid (physical)           = balance(treasury)       ← physical withdrawal also bounded by this
health                      = E / M                   (computed on demand, never stored)
```

Three zones (the VM-into-buffer model):

```
E ≥ R          healthy   → can withdraw excess (E − R); VM lands in free funds, claimable
M ≤ E < R      buffer    → no withdrawals; VM eats the IM cushion
E < M          liquidate → close out, release IMs, pay winner from what's recoverable
```

**Why `available` is saturating + double-gated:** once reserved IM is supplied
into DeepBook, `balance(treasury)` drops below `reserved`. `available` counts
`rehypothecated` so the economic figure stays correct, but a physical withdrawal
is additionally capped by the liquid balance — you must `recall` first to
liquefy. (This is the audited-OZ "don't let saturating-sub mask a broken
invariant" discipline applied.)

---

## 7. Oracle — what it tracks

A keeper-pushed price book. Per symbol (`Feed`):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `price` | current price, `PRICE_SCALE = 1e6` (USD, 6 dp) |
| `prev_price` | price before the last push (for the jump calc) |
| `last_update_ms` | timestamp of last push |
| `jump_threshold_bps` | latch the trigger if `|Δ|/prev` exceeds this |
| `triggered` | **sticky** — true until an admin clears it |

`push_price` recomputes `jump_bps = |new − prev|·10000/prev` and latches
`triggered` when it exceeds the threshold. The demo **crash button** is the
keeper pushing a far-off price → `triggered = true` → permissionless
`recall_on_trigger` becomes callable. (Pyth pull-oracle integration is the
stretch upgrade; Pyth is already available transitively via `deepbook_margin`.)

1. **Deposit** — admin funds the treasury.
2. **Reserve** — opening a contract encumbers IM (`reserved += IM`); no funds move.
3. **Rehypothecate** — admin supplies idle/posted collateral into the DeepBook
   margin pool; `balance` drops, `rehypothecated` rises, `equity` unchanged.
4. **Earn** — `supplied_value()` reads the live position (principal + interest).
5. **Settle (MTM)** — each interval, net VM+funding moves loser→winner's free pool.
6. **Recall** — admin anytime, or **anyone** when the oracle trigger latches
   (risk-responsive auto-deleverage). Funds return to liquid balance.
7. **Liquidate** — if a loser can't cover, IMs are released and the winner is
   paid from what's recoverable.

## 10. RFQ — async request → firm quote → single-signer accept (BUILT)

The `rfq` module is the **answer to "how is IM escrowed after RFQ"** and resolves
the one hard problem: `otc_forward::open` needs *both* desks' `TraderCap`s in one
transaction, but RFQ is inherently async. The design (chosen after studying
Variational Pro, Paradigm, 0x, Hashflow) is **on-chain firm quotes** — and it
deliberately **drops last-look** (a TradFi FX artifact that's hostile to a
trust-minimized chain): a maker can *pull* a quote, but can't renege after it's
accepted.

```
open_rfq (requester)        → shared Rfq<C>          [no margin locked; targets = maker IDs or broadcast]
submit_quote (maker signs)  → shared Quote<C> + maker IM FIRM-reserved
                              under RfqWitness, keyed by the Quote id   [maker can now go offline]
  withdraw_quote / reclaim  → release the firm IM                       [pull / permissionless cleanup]
accept_quote (REQUESTER only) → otc_forward::open_from_rfq:
                                • reserve requester IM (live cap, OtcWitness)
                                • RE-KEY maker IM  quote_id→otc_id, RfqWitness→OtcWitness
                                • share OtcForward<C>                   [both sides bound, ONE signer]
… then the deployed settle / close / liquidation run UNCHANGED.
```

**The async-open resolution.** The maker commits at *quote* time (it co-signs
`submit_quote` with its own cap, firm-reserving IM — `reserve_margin` enforces
`deployed + im ≤ book_size` and `im ≤ available`, so a maker physically can't
publish a quote it can't back). `accept_quote` is signed by the **requester
alone**: it reserves the requester leg with the live requester cap, then
`rekey_reservation` relabels the maker's existing reservation onto the fresh
contract id and swaps its witness `RfqWitness → OtcWitness` — a pure accounting
relabel (no counter changes, magnitudes asserted equal), so no maker
co-signature and no maker fade. IM is still **escrowed by reservation**, never
moved.

**Asymmetric commitment, by design:** the maker (whose price must be trustworthy)
locks firm collateral when it quotes; the requester commits nothing until the
single accept tx it signs. A maker's firm-quote lockup is bounded by the quote
TTL via permissionless `reclaim_expired_quote`.

`RfqWitness` lives in `otc_forward` (not `rfq`) so the module dependency is
one-way (`rfq → otc_forward`), and is allowlisted by `ProtocolCap` like
`OtcWitness`. *Deferred seam:* off-chain ed25519-signed quotes (Paradigm/0x
style) for streaming scale, reusing `open_from_rfq` verbatim.

---

## 10b. Direct offer — "type the counterparty's org ID" (BUILT)

For a trader who already knows its counterparty and the terms, the `direct`
module skips the competitive auction. It is the **mirror of RFQ** — the *commit
order is flipped* — and reuses `open_from_rfq`/`RfqWitness` with **zero new
settlement code and no new witness to allowlist**.

```
propose_direct (proposer)   → shared DirectOffer<C> + proposer IM FIRM-reserved
                              under RfqWitness, keyed by the offer id   [names ONE counterparty; price FIXED]
  withdraw_direct / reclaim → release the firm IM                       [pull / permissionless cleanup]
accept_direct (COUNTERPARTY only) → otc_forward::open_from_rfq:
                                • reserve acceptor IM (live cap, OtcWitness)
                                • RE-KEY proposer IM  offer_id→otc_id, RfqWitness→OtcWitness
                                • share OtcForward<C>                   [both sides bound, ONE signer]
```

| | RFQ | Direct |
|---|---|---|
| Audience | broadcast / N targets | exactly one named `counterparty_inst` |
| Price | makers compete | fixed by proposer |
| Commits collateral first | the responder (maker) | the initiator (proposer) |
| Live signer at open | requester | counterparty |
| Escape hatches | `withdraw_quote` / `reclaim_expired_quote` | `withdraw_direct` / `reclaim_expired_direct` |

In `accept_direct`, only the institution whose `object::id` equals
`offer.counterparty_inst` can accept, and the proposer plays `open_from_rfq`'s
"maker"/pre-committed role while the acceptor plays the "requester"/live role —
so the same re-key seam binds both legs under a single signer. Money-safety is
identical to RFQ: a live offer always frees via the proposer's pull or the
permissionless TTL reclaim.

---

## 11. Design decisions (with evidence)

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Collateral layout | One pooled `Balance<C>` per institution; positions are records, not objects | DeepBook `BalanceManager`/`MarginManager` and PREDICT all pool collateral in one object; none make a position a standalone object |
| Contract representation | OTC contract = its own shared object | Bilateral & bespoke (vs standardized exchange positions); mirrors PREDICT's shared `ExpiryMarket` |
| Per-institution roles | Capability objects + allowlists | OZ `access_control` is one-registry-per-module (OTW) — can't be per-tenant; our caps add epoch+VecSet revocation |
| Cross-margin risk | Reservation **sum** now; risk **netting** deferred | DeepBook Margin itself forbids true multi-pool cross-margin (`ECannotHaveLoanInMoreThanOneMarginPool`) — netting is genuinely hard |
| Health metric | Computed on demand, never stored | `MarginManager.risk_ratio()` is a pure view; only events store a ratio |
| Signed PnL | OZ `fp_math` `SD29x9` | Move has no signed ints; audited fixed-point is the right tool |
| Safe arithmetic | OZ `math::u128::mul_div` + rounding | overflow-safe `a·b/c`, audited |
| Institution ID | On-chain `HandleRegistry`, not SuiNS | SuiNS has no Move-callable registration, its target is mutable, costs SUI per name |
| Cross-package auth | `drop` witness + ProtocolCap allowlist | no admin power leaks to the OTC/rehypo packages; ProtocolCap is the kill-switch |

---

## 12. OZ + DeepBook integration

- **OZ libraries (git, audited v1.2.0):** `openzeppelin_math` (`u128::mul_div`,
  `rounding`, `decimal_scaling`) and `openzeppelin_fp_math` (`SD29x9` signed,
  `UD30x9` unsigned, 9-decimal scale). MVR is unavailable on Sui CLI 1.72.1, so
  the git form is used.
- **Decimal bridge:** `fp_math` is hardwired to 9 decimals; DBUSDC is 6. Lift a
  1e6-scaled int into the 9dp domain with `ud30x9::wrap(x · 1000)`; for a
  non-negative `SD29x9`, `unwrap(abs(pnl)) / 1000` gives the 6dp magnitude.
- **DeepBook margin API** (`deepbook_margin::margin_pool`): `mint_supplier_cap`,
  `supply<Asset>(pool, registry, &cap, coin, referral, clock)`,
  `withdraw<Asset>(pool, registry, &cap, Option<amount>, clock, ctx)`,
  `user_supply_amount(pool, cap_id, clock)` — all `public`, no sender checks, so
  a shared object holding the `SupplierCap` is the lender.

## 13. Deployment — LIVE on testnet

The package **builds, unit-tests pass** (12 tests; `contracts/run-tests.sh`), and
is **deployed to testnet**, with the full rehypothecation loop, the RFQ path, and
the direct-offer path all proven on-chain with real DBUSDC.

**How the dependency-publish hurdle was solved — MVR.** Publishing links against
the deployed DeepBook on testnet; the deepbookv3 source revs ship no publish
records, so the address can only come from an external resolver. The fix was the
**MVR (Move Registry) resolver** (`mvr` binary installed on PATH):
`deepbook_margin = { r.mvr = "@deepbook/margin-trading/13" }` in `Move.toml`.
Note: only **version 13** of that MVR package carries git source (the latest, 14,
does not), so the version is pinned. OZ math stays a git dep (it ships
`Published.toml`).

**Proven loops:**
- `scripts/deploy-test.ts` — create institution → deposit 50 DBUSDC →
  `rehypothecate` into the live DBUSDC margin pool (`0xf08568…`) → register an
  oracle feed + push a crash price (latch the trigger) → `recall_on_trigger`
  pulls the 50 DBUSDC back. Observed: `rehypothecated` 50→0 and liquid treasury
  0→50 across the recall.
- `scripts/two-inst-rfq.ts` — two institutions (Goldwoman ↔ Cumberland), 100
  DBUSDC each: `open_rfq` → `submit_quote` (firm-reserve 20) → `accept_quote`
  opens the OtcForward, single signer. Both legs reserved 20.
- `scripts/two-inst-direct.ts` — same two desks via the **direct** path:
  `propose_direct` (proposer firm-reserves 20) → `accept_direct` by the named
  counterparty opens the OtcForward. Both legs reserved 20.

## 14. Deferred / roadmap (contract side)

- **Off-chain signed quotes** — ed25519-signed maker quotes redeemed on-chain
  (Paradigm/0x style) for streaming scale, reusing `open_from_rfq` (see §10).
  The on-chain firm-quote RFQ is built; this is the scale seam.
- **Makers competing on funding rate** (not just price), and IM-band negotiation.
- **Cross-margin risk netting** — offset longs/shorts into one health number
  (currently a reservation sum); a standalone computed-view engine over `contracts`.
- **Trader-initiated withdrawal** — `withdraw_permission` is stored but no
  trader-signed withdraw entry yet.
- **Pyth oracle** — replace/augment the keeper oracle with Pyth pull updates.
- **ISDA-style grace/notice** before close-out; **maker/checker** on treasury moves.
- **Partial-recall handling** under DeepBook withdrawal rate limits (mainnet).
